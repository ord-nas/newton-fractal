# Shared Directory
	
This directory is shared between the virtual machine and with Windows host.
* On Ubuntu: ~/Documents/Newton Fractal/
  * Emacs rsyncs this directory to /mnt/hgfs/Newton Fractal/, which is the real shared directory location.
* On Windows: C:\Users\young\Documents\Newton Fractal

Note, for some reason, on boot sometimes the shared directory doesn't appear in Ubuntu.
To fix, toggle shared directory off and on again (seriously).
* Player > Manage > Virtual Machine Settings... > Options > Shared Folders > Disabled
* Player > Manage > Virtual Machine Settings... > Options > Shared Folders > Always enabled

# Javascript Prototype

js_prototype directory contains an initial client-side-only prototype.

To use, just point your browser at js_prototype/fractal.html

This just displays a single static fractal. It takes a long time (~20 seconds) to generate the fractal.

This is likely too slow to be useful.

# Crow

The crow directory contains what is hopefully the actual project architecture.

We will use a C++ backend (using the Crow webserver library, https://crowcpp.org/) and have that talk to a javascript frontend.

## Setup

Install crow. Download the latest .deb file from the release section of Crow's website.

At the time of starting this project, that was crow-v1.0+5.deb (included in this repository).

Open in file explorer and click to install in Ubuntu Software Center.

Then also install some dependencies.
* Asio: sudo apt install libasio-dev
* Boost: sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
* PNG++: sudo apt-get install libpng++-dev
* Eigen: Download and place headers in /usr/include
  * Note, this is not actually required unless _IMPLEMENT_COMPLEX_ARRAY_WITH_EIGEN_ is set, which it currently *is not*
  * Download eigen-3.4.0 (from https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen/-/archive/3.4.0/eigen-3.4.0.tar.gz)
  * Docs that led to this link: https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page
  * Extract the archived, it should be a single directory eigen-3.4.0
  * The source code is in eigen-3.4.0/Eigen
  * Copy that into /usr/include: sudo cp -r ~/Downloads/eigen-3.4.0/Eigen/ /usr/include/

## Compile

Compile with make, using the dumbest makefile ever.

$ make

## Run

Run two different ways:

1. Run inside of the Ubuntu VM.

Run:

$ ./fractal_server

Then access http://<vm_ip_address>:18080/ on the host machine.
(see ~/Documents/Canvas/web_server_info.txt for instructions on getting the IP address, section 1B)

2. Run in bash on Windows.

Make sure the shared directory is working and the sync is up to date.

Start bash on windows.

Navigate to the Shared Directory (Windows directories are mounted):

$ cd /mnt/c/Users/young/Documents/Newton\ Fractal/crow

Run:

$ ./fractal_server

Then access http://localhost:18080
